# BUG-014 — DCF working-capital term includes cash → negative projected FCF → systematic undervaluation

**Status:** RESOLVED — CLOSED & ARCHIVED 2026-06-06 (live-validated). Operating NWC excludes cash; `CalculationVersion` 4.4 → 4.5 (now 4.6 after BUG-015); regression tests added; DDM bit-for-bit + DC-1 invariants green. Passed full `/execute` B-V-R-Q (VERIFIER VERIFIED, REVIEWER APPROVE_WITH_NITS, QA PASS) + an independent `/code-review` (REVIEWER APPROVE_WITH_NITS, QA PASS). SECONDARY `dcf.go:122` scaling change deliberately NOT applied (see §8). **Live validation (2026-06-06, §9):** a freshly-built server on :8095 hit the live `GET /api/v1/fair-value/{NVDA,KO,AMD}` (all 3 data sources OK, no cache) — NVDA `dcf_per_year_pv` flipped from the bug's all-negative `[-3.85, -4.91, -6.26, -7.58, -8.68]e9` to all-positive `[+79.7, +101.9, +130.3, +158.1, +181.4]e9`, terminal dominance 104% → 81%, intrinsic +$142.05, `calculation_version 4.6`. The former "STILL OPEN" §5 quarterly-base item shipped separately as **BUG-015** (also live-validated & archived); the operator fresh-baseline item is satisfied by this live run + the saved CalcVersion-4.6 baseline (`docs/accuracy/report-2026-06-05.md`).
**Severity:** HIGH — core DCF valuation is wrong across the whole basket. 9/10 tickers value below market by a mean of −84%; KO and AMD produce **negative** intrinsic values (model breakdown, not conservatism).
**Filed:** 2026-06-03, from the `/debug` track opened on the finding the new `cmd/accuracy` harness surfaced.
**Area:** BACKEND — valuation engine (`internal/services/valuation` + `pkg/finance/dcf`).
**Regression oracle:** `cmd/accuracy` over `artifacts/tier2-baseline/2026-06-03/` (report: `docs/accuracy/report-2026-06-03.md`, on branch `feat/accuracy-harness`). After the fix, the mean absolute gap should collapse and `NEG_INTRINSIC` / `NEG_FCF_YEARS` flags should clear for cash-rich names.

---

## 1. Symptom

`cmd/accuracy` over the fresh CalcVersion-4.4 baseline:

- Mean **absolute** intrinsic-vs-price gap = **86.7%**; 9/10 tickers below market (mean −84%).
- **KO intrinsic = −$14.77**, **AMD intrinsic = −$38.70** (negative).
- AAPL/NVDA/MSFT: terminal PV = 96–106% of enterprise value (explicit window sums ~0 or negative).
- `NEG_FCF_YEARS` on KO, AMD, AAPL, NVDA; `TERMINAL_DOMINANCE` on AAPL, NVDA, MSFT.

Signature (NVDA `17-response.json`): every explicit-year discounted FCF is negative —
`dcf_per_year_pv = [-3.85e9, -4.91e9, -6.26e9, -7.58e9, -8.68e9]`, growing more negative each year; `dcf_terminal_pct_of_ev = 1.043`.

## 2. Evidence (captured 4.4 bundles, hermetic — no live calls)

| | NVDA | KO |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $81.6B | $12.47B (quarterly — see §5 obs) |
| Operating income | $53.5B | $4.36B |
| D&A | $1.0B | — |
| CapEx | $1.8B | $0.27B |
| → NOPAT + D&A − CapEx | **≈ +$42B** | ≈ +$3.2B |
| **CurrentAssets** | **$150.995B** | $30.39B |
| CurrentLiabilities | $43.884B | $22.378B |
| **NWC = CA − CL (as coded)** | **$107.1B** | $8.0B |
| Cash & equivalents (inside CA) | $13.2B | **$10.57B** |
| `operating_cash_flow` in cleaned data | 0 | 0 |

NVDA's coded NWC is **$107B on $81.6B of revenue** — impossible as *operating* working capital; it is dominated by the cash + short-term-investment hoard lumped into `other_current_assets` ($112B). KO's cash ($10.57B) **exceeds its entire coded NWC ($8.0B)** — true operating NWC is negative (supplier float), but the engine sees +$8B.

Back-solving NVDA year-1 FCF (PV −3.85B ⇒ undiscounted ≈ −4.4B): `42 + scaledDA − scaledCapEx − scaledΔNWC = −4.4` ⇒ ΔNWC ≈ **$31B** — i.e. the year-over-year jump in the cash-polluted NWC, not an operating-WC change.

## 3. Reproduction

```bash
# Hermetic re-run through the current engine:
go run ./cmd/replay --from=parsed --diff-stages --verbose \
  artifacts/tier2-baseline/2026-06-03/NVDA/req_*/
# Or read the captured outputs directly:
#   artifacts/tier2-baseline/2026-06-03/{NVDA,KO,AMD}/req_*/{10-clean-output,15-valuation,17-response}.json
# Or run the harness report:
go run ./cmd/accuracy --dir artifacts/tier2-baseline/2026-06-03
```

## 4. Root cause

**PRIMARY — working capital includes cash.** `internal/services/valuation/service.go::calculateNetWorkingCapitalChange` (≈ line 1980) computes:

```go
latestNWC := latestView.CurrentAssets - latestView.CurrentLiabilities   // includes cash, ST investments, ST debt
...
return latestNWC - priorNWC
```

`CurrentAssets` includes cash & cash-equivalents and short-term/marketable investments; `CurrentLiabilities` includes the current portion of debt. For cash-accumulating firms the year-over-year change in `CA − CL` is dominated by the cash/investment build, which is mis-counted as **working capital invested** (a cash outflow) in FCF. Standard FCF practice uses *operating* NWC:

```
operating NWC = (CurrentAssets − Cash&Equivalents − ShortTermInvestments)
              − (CurrentLiabilities − ShortTermDebt)
ΔNWC          = operatingNWC_latest − operatingNWC_prior
```

Cash accumulation is a *result* of free cash flow, never a use of it — including it double-counts and inverts the sign of FCF for exactly the high-quality, cash-generative companies the engine most needs to value correctly.

**CONTRIBUTING — base ΔNWC scaled by cumulative growth.** `pkg/finance/dcf/dcf.go:122`:

```go
scaledNWCChange := inputs.NetWorkingCapitalChange * growthFactor   // growthFactor = cumulative OI growth
freeCashFlow = nopat + scaledDA - scaledCapEx - scaledNWCChange
```

A single base-year ΔNWC is multiplied by the **cumulative** operating-income growth factor every projection year, so the already-overstated ΔNWC grows monotonically across the explicit window — this is why `dcf_per_year_pv` gets *more* negative each year (−3.85B → −8.68B). Economically, incremental WC for year *t* should be ≈ `operatingNWC_{t-1} × revenueGrowth_t`, not `baseΔNWC × cumulativeGrowth`.

**Cascade:** overstated ΔNWC → negative projected FCF → negative terminal-year FCF → negative terminal value (Gordon) → negative/under-stated EV → negative or deeply-understated intrinsic value per share.

## 5. Observations (separate, do not fix under this ticket)

- **DC-1 Phase-0 plug lumping:** the cleaner currently absorbs the current-asset/-liability umbrellas into `other_current_assets/liabilities` (see CLAUDE.md DC-1 Phase-0 notes), so a clean cash/ST-debt exclusion may need either the parser to expose `CashAndCashEquivalents` + `ShortTermInvestments` + `ShortTermDebt` separately (NVDA cash is available: $13.2B) or a documented approximation. Scope the data availability before the fix.
- **`operating_cash_flow = 0`** in cleaned data (unused by the `UseTrueFCF` path, but a latent cleaner gap).
- **KO base looks quarterly** (OI $4.36B / revenue $12.47B) — if a 10-Q period feeds the DCF annual base, NOPAT is ~4× understated, compounding the negative FCF. Possible separate DCF-quarterly-base issue (cf. RM-1 for the revenue-multiple model). Confirm before fixing.

## 6. Proposed fix (for a dedicated branch — NOT this harness branch)

1. In `calculateNetWorkingCapitalChange`, subtract cash & cash-equivalents (and short-term investments, when available) from `CurrentAssets`, and short-term debt from `CurrentLiabilities`, on **both** latest and prior, before the delta. Guard the data-availability path (fall back to a documented behavior when components are unavailable).
2. Reconsider `dcf.go:122` — incremental WC should scale with the **per-year** revenue/OI growth increment, not the cumulative factor (or pass a pre-computed per-year ΔNWC series).
3. **Regression test (mandatory):** a per-year FCF decomposition assertion on NVDA/KO/AMD inputs — projected FCF must be positive for cash-generative firms; pin `dcf_per_year_pv > 0` and intrinsic > 0 for KO/AMD. Use the captured bundles as fixtures.
4. Re-run `cmd/accuracy` over a re-captured 4.4 baseline; the mean absolute gap should drop materially and `NEG_INTRINSIC`/`NEG_FCF_YEARS` should clear.

**Risk / care:** valuation math is load-bearing. Respect DC-1 invariants (this changes `dcf_value_per_share` for most tickers by design → a deliberate, documented `CalculationVersion` bump; coordinate with the DDM bit-for-bit golden fixtures, which are dividend-derived and unaffected, and with the `tier2-baseline` replay expectations). Capture a fresh baseline after the fix.

## 7. Change log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-03 | Filed from the `/debug` track. Root cause confirmed from source (`calculateNetWorkingCapitalChange` + `dcf.go:122`) and quantified on captured 4.4 bundles (NVDA NWC $107B incl. cash; KO cash > NWC). Engine fix deferred to a dedicated branch; `cmd/accuracy` is the regression oracle. |
| 2026-06-04 | PRIMARY fix implemented on `fix/dcf-nwc-cash` (operating NWC excludes cash & equivalents; `CalculationVersion` 4.4 → 4.5). SECONDARY `dcf.go:122` change deliberately NOT applied — see §8. Awaiting VERIFIER + fresh 4.5 baseline capture (operator). |
| 2026-06-06 | Live-validated through a freshly-built server (see §9) and **CLOSED/ARCHIVED**. NVDA per-year PV all-positive, terminal 81%, calc 4.6. Fix merged to master as `831de9b`. |

## 8. Implementation outcome (BACKEND, 2026-06-04)

**Field-availability finding (Step 0).** Only `CashAndCashEquivalents` is exposed
as its own field on `entities.FinancialData` (and now on the `cleaneddata`
`FinancialDataView`). There is **no** `ShortTermInvestments`/marketable-securities
field and **no** `ShortTermDebt`/current-portion-of-debt field: the DC-1 Phase-0
plug invariant `CurrentAssets == Cash + Inventory + OtherCurrentAssets` lumps
short-term investments into `OtherCurrentAssets`, and `CurrentLiabilities ==
OperatingLeaseLiabilityCurrent + OtherCurrentLiabilities` lumps short-term debt
into `OtherCurrentLiabilities`. Confirmed on the captured 4.4 bundles: NVDA
`other_current_assets = $111.96B` (the unisolable short-term-investment hoard),
KO `$15.09B`, AMD `$15.00B`. **The fix therefore excludes cash & equivalents
only** — the reliably-available component — and documents the approximation in
`calculateNetWorkingCapitalChange`. Isolating ST investments / ST debt requires a
parser-side change (out of scope; candidate follow-up).

**Primary fix (shipped).** `calculateNetWorkingCapitalChange` now computes
`operatingNWC = (CurrentAssets − Cash&Equivalents) − CurrentLiabilities` on both
the latest and prior periods (still read from `AsReported()` — the C-2 zero-drift
rationale is preserved; cash is identity-copied across all views, so the
subtraction is drift-neutral with respect to the cleaner). `CalculationVersion`
bumped 4.4 → 4.5 at both stamp sites; the four live pins in `service_test.go`
updated.

**Secondary fix (`dcf.go:122`) — DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED.** The primary fix
alone restores positive projected FCF for the canonical cash-rich case (NVDA:
`dcf_per_year_pv` flips −3.85B → +2.07B across the window; `dcf_value_per_share`
29.60 → 34.22; terminal dominance 104% → 98%). KO/AMD remain negative, but the
year-1 FCF decomposition proves this is **not** "purely" the cumulative-scaling
overstatement — it is dominated by the §5 **quarterly-base** problem (KO/AMD base
OI is a 10-Q figure, ~4× understated NOPAT), which is explicitly out of scope.
Even switching to per-year-increment scaling does not flip AMD year-1 FCF
positive (NOPAT_y1 1.53B − CapEx 0.51B − incrementalΔWC 1.33B = −0.32B), so the
secondary change would introduce engine-wide drift across every DCF ticker (large
blast radius, no clean validation oracle) without achieving the success criterion
for the names it would target. Per the fix mandate ("if the primary fix alone
restores positive FCF, leave dcf.go as-is"), `dcf.go:122` is unchanged.
**Follow-up candidate:** reconsider the base-ΔNWC scaling semantics (constant vs
per-year-increment vs cumulative) as its own ARCH-reviewed change, alongside the
DCF-quarterly-base fix (§5).

**Replay evidence (hermetic, `--from=parsed`, vs captured 4.4 baseline).** DCF
tickers move toward market: NVDA 29.60 → 34.22, AAPL 20.66 → 33.37, MSFT 68.18 →
92.44, AMD −38.70 → −21.68 (negativity halved), F 32.86 → 23.75 (cash-release
benefit correctly trimmed), KO −14.77 → −15.52 (quarterly-base-bound). DDM (JPM),
FFO (PLD), and revenue_multiple (MXL) primary values are bit-for-bit unchanged —
only `calculation_version` drifts for those — confirming the NWC fix is contained
to the DCF FCF path. (EQIX shows growth/WACC drift that is **pre-existing replay
non-determinism**, reproduced with the fix stashed — not attributable to BUG-014.)
A fresh 4.5 `cmd/accuracy` mean-gap number requires a re-captured baseline
(operator follow-up; `cmd/accuracy` reads saved `17-response.json`, not the live
engine).

## 9. Live validation (2026-06-06) — CLOSED

Built `./cmd/server` from the merged tree (fix at `831de9b`), seeded a demo key,
ran a cold-cache instance on `:8095`, and hit the **live** API
(`GET /api/v1/fair-value/{ticker}` — no `trace`, no warm cache; the server log
confirms `fetch.fanout … sources_ok: 3` for each ticker, i.e. genuine live
SEC/market/macro fetches, not replay).

| | live 4.6 | bug's captured 4.4 signature |
|---|---|---|
| NVDA `dcf_per_year_pv` (e9) | **`[+79.7, +101.9, +130.3, +158.1, +181.4]`** | `[-3.85, -4.91, -6.26, -7.58, -8.68]` (all negative) |
| NVDA `dcf_terminal_pct_of_ev` | **0.812** | 1.043 |
| NVDA `dcf_value_per_share` | **+142.05** | 29.60 (pre-fix replay) |
| NVDA `calculation_version` | **4.6** | 4.4 |

The defining BUG-014 signature — every explicit-year discounted FCF negative and
growing more negative — is **gone**: all five projection years are now positive.
KO/AMD intrinsic also positive (KO +15.74, AMD +6.97), though their residual
negative *per-year* FCF (AMD) is the separate reinvestment/operating-leverage
issue tracked in `docs/refactoring/spec/dcf-reinvestment-and-filing-intelligence-spec.md`,
not this ticket. Live numbers match the saved CalcVersion-4.6 baseline
(`docs/accuracy/report-2026-06-05.md`). **Bug closed and archived.**
